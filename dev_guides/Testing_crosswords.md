# Testing Daily Crosswords

This guide explains how to test the daily crossword functionality during development.

## Problem

The production app generates crosswords once per day at midnight via GitHub Actions. During development, you need to test with multiple crosswords without waiting 24 hours.

## Solution: Testing Endpoints

I've added special testing endpoints that allow you to generate fresh crosswords on demand.

---

## Testing Endpoints

### 1. Generate New Crossword(s)

**Endpoint:** `POST /crossword/test/generate-new`

**Purpose:** Generate a fresh crossword to test with

#### Examples:

**Generate both solo AND battle crosswords:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/crossword/test/generate-new \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

**Generate only solo crossword:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/crossword/test/generate-new \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"mode": "solo"}'
```

**Generate only battle crossword:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/crossword/test/generate-new \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"mode": "battle"}'
```

**Generate with custom theme:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/crossword/test/generate-new \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"mode": "solo", "theme": "ocean"}'
```

#### Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Test crossword(s) generated successfully",
  "results": {
    "solo": {
      "theme": "nature",
      "status": "generated",
      "file": "solo_play.json"
    },
    "battle": {
      "theme": "technology",
      "status": "generated",
      "file": "battle_play.json"
    }
  },
  "note": "This endpoint is for testing only. Production uses scheduled generation.",
  "timestamp": "2025-11-23T15:30:00.123456"
}
```

### 2. Clear All Crosswords

**Endpoint:** `DELETE /crossword/test/clear-all`

**Purpose:** Delete all crossword files to test the "no crossword available" error state

#### Example:
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8000/crossword/test/clear-all
```

#### Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Deleted 3 file(s)",
  "deleted_files": [
    "latest_crossword.json",
    "solo_play.json",
    "battle_play.json"
  ]
}
```

## Testing Workflows

### Test Solo Play Mode:

1. **Start backend:**
```bash
   cd backend
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

2. **Generate fresh solo crossword:**
```bash
   curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/crossword/test/generate-new \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"mode": "solo"}'
```

3. **Start frontend and play:**
```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
```
   Click "Solo Play" - you'll get the fresh crossword!

4. **Want another crossword? Repeat step 2**

---

### Test Battle Play Mode:

Same as above, but use `"mode": "battle"` and click "Battle Play" in the frontend.

---

### Test "No Crossword Available" Error:

1. **Clear all crosswords:**
```bash
   curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8000/crossword/test/clear-all
```

2. **Try to play:**
   - Frontend should show: "No crossword available. Wait for daily generation."

3. **Fix by generating new ones:**
```bash
   curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/crossword/test/generate-new
```

## Important Notes

⚠️ **These endpoints are for TESTING ONLY**
- They should NOT be used in production
- They are not called by GitHub Actions
- They do NOT affect the scheduled daily generation

✅ **Production Behavior:**
- GitHub Actions generates crosswords at midnight daily
- Users cannot trigger generation manually
- Testing endpoints are ignored in production

🔒 **Security Note:**
- In production, you may want to add authentication to these test endpoints
- Or remove them entirely before deploying

## Troubleshooting

**Problem:** "No crossword available"
- **Solution:** Run `POST /crossword/test/generate-new` to create one

**Problem:** Crossword generation takes 20-30 seconds
- **Solution:** This is normal - OpenAI API + clue generation takes time

**Problem:** "Failed to generate crossword"
- **Solution:** Check your OpenAI API key in `.env` file
- Make sure you have credits in your OpenAI account

**Problem:** Clues don't match the grid
- **Solution:** This was fixed - make sure you have the latest `SoloPlay.jsx`

## Quick Commands Cheat Sheet
```bash
# Generate both crosswords with random themes
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/crossword/test/generate-new

# Generate solo only
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/crossword/test/generate-new \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"mode": "solo"}'

# Generate with custom theme
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/crossword/test/generate-new \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"mode": "solo", "theme": "space"}'

# Clear all crosswords
curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8000/crossword/test/clear-all

# Check if crosswords exist
ls backend/app/*.json
```

## Questions?

If you have issues with testing, check:
1. Is the backend running? (`uvicorn app.main:app --reload`)
2. Do you have a valid OpenAI API key in `.env`?
3. Are you in the correct directory when running curl commands?
4. Did you wait 20-30 seconds for generation to complete?
5. If anything else, just send a message to me, Kiann!
