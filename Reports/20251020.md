# Team Report 10/20
## Project Meeting Agenda:
Team member updates on progress.
Meeting goal setting:
Finalize any changes to Living Doc 
Submit for Design milestone

## Last week’s goals:
	-finalize database schema
	-get main menu (login/play as guest) rendered
	-setup login/signup to read/write to database
## Progress and Issues:
  -some obstacles around github permissions/forking, learning curve there with getting local env setup for all team members
  -learned that chat gpt api calls are limited… spend money to get more or else find different LLM to use for word generation
  -menu screen is rendered according to figma
  -login button is functional and takes to login screen
  -sign up/log in flow works and reads/writes to database
  -verification email gets automatically sent to verify new accounts

## Plans and goals:
	-do research into alternative LLMs we can make api calls to
  -create path to pass words (ones we pick for now, not LLM generated) to frontend
  -work on frontend rendering of dashboard page (where user can select multiplayer, solo play, or their stats if they are signed in)
	

## Individual Contributions
### Last week’s goals: 
  Jacqui: buy a domain name, get backend hosted on Render and frontend hosted on Vercel by 10/17, start working on login logic to write to database 10/17 to 10/20
  Danielle: 10/17 create sample data in all non authentication tables, set up table restrictions so that users cannot write to other users stats, forge their own stats, prevent users from reading other users private data. By 10/19 write database get and post request and test. 
  Kiann: Get up ChatGPT API connection by 10/15. Make sure sample calls are being made without error by 10/17. Add ability from Frontend to request words by 10/17. 
  Anna: Set up localhost by 10/15. Develop Menu page of website with working buttons (frontend week 4 goal), Make the login button by 10/16.
### Progress and issues: 
  Jacqui: Login/signup flow writes to database, email verification is required and an automatic email is sent upon signup/user creation to verify the email. Bought crosswars.xyz, but has not set up hosting on Render or Vercel yet. I decided this can happen later into the project and prioritized work on connecting login to the database.
  Danielle: sample data in non authentication tables. Decided it is best to wait until we are able to do basic read and write tests before adding table restrictions. Ended up starting supabase multiplayer research rather than get and post tests.
	Kiann: ChatGPT has limited API calls. Need to find a workaround/ invest money to buy    more calls. Bug fixes and make it communicate with backend. 
  Anna: Having issues pushing my code to the git. Need to troubleshoot permissions. Constructed the menu page, including play as guest and login buttons. Need to connect to the backend to make them actually functional.

### Plans and goals:
  Jacqui: work on setting up sending words to frontend, do some research on the python crossword builder library and figure out the best way to send the board pattern/words to the frontend for rendering
  Danielle: Get data get and post tests working by 10/22. Continuing research for multiplayer and begin setup to support multiplayer 10/24.
  Kiann: Get ChatGPT API running smoothly and set up interactive backend by 10/25. Set up OPENAI project platform by 10/22. 
  Anna: Figure out git forking and pushing. Work with backend to connect frontend interface for home and login pages. Clarify the linking plan for the different login screens. Begin constructing crossword UI.
