# CrossWars — free, social, mini-crosswords


## Abstract / TL;DR
CrossWars is a free web app that delivers a daily mini-crossword and adds realtime social competition: solve solo or race friends while seeing each other’s progress. 
Our goal is to make bite-sized crossword fun accessible, social, and paywall-free.

## Goals

 - Provide a free daily mini-crossword experience.

 - Support solo play and realtime multiplayer races.

 - Track player stats and leaderboards.

 - Use a clear, beginner-friendly UI while keeping competitive features for advanced users.

 - Offer an AI-assisted puzzle generation pipeline (experimental).
